# Quick Start

### 1. Permissions
In order to broadcast, you will also need an internet connection, a background mode, a camera and a microphone. To use them, add the following permissions to your app's Info.plist file:
``` swift
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow record video</string>
    <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Allow record microphone</string>
    <key>UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents</key>
    <true/>
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
        <string>audio</string>
```
### 2. Start streaming
Streaming with default params:
``` swift
let rtmpManager = RTMPStreamManager()
rtmpManager.start()
rtmpManager.play()

rtmpManager.close()
```

You can find out how to get rtmpUrl for streaming in the EdgeCenter API [documentation](https://apidocs.edgecenter.ru/streaming#tag/Streams).
